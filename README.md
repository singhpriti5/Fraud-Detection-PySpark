# Fraud-Detection-PySpark

The analysis is done with Apache Spark interface PySpark and MLlibs(Machine Learning Libraries).

Financial datasets are important to many researchers in the domain of fraud detection.

The aim is to propose a generalized model that could help solve real world problems with appropriate Machine Learning tools.
